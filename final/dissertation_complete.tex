\section{Motivation} \label{sec:motivation}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The study of textures and their strength has a number of applications in both industry and academia. Textures, or lattice preferred orientations (LPO) arise in rocks that have undergone ductile deformation. The properties of this LPO are dependant on the strain history, and in general increased strain leads to a \lq{}stronger\rq{} LPO \textbf{REF?}. If LPO strength can be quantified by a texture index, and this index can be reliably related to strain, then it could prove a useful tool in determining strain in situations where it is impossible to measure though conventional means.

This is especially applicable to mantle studies. Relating the formation and strength of textures in peridotites to shear strain is important, as this gives insight into how deformation mechanisms lead to seismic anisotropy \citep{Warren2008}. Understanding these processes is key in determining upper mantle convection through seismic anisotropy studies \citep[e.g.][]{Blackman2002}. A metric that can act as a proxy for texture strength would be beneficial to mantle studies, as most peridotites lack strain markers \citep{Tommasi2000}.

In addition to estimating strain from samples, texture indices could also offer a method of indirectly determining strain and other properties of textures via seismology. \cite{Tommasi1999} study ... other regions e.g. \cite{Wenk1999}   

Aside from these general applications, a more direct motivation arises from \cite{Skemer}. After introducing their metric (the M-index) and applying it to olivine, they state that \lq\lq{}further research is necessary to confirm the M-index's validity or practicality for other materials\rq\rq{}, which gives clear scope for a project to investigate this. In order to confirm its validity, it is also necessary to compare the M-index with a number of other metrics in a similar fashion to \cite{Mainprice}, but with greater detail and for a number of crystal structures. This leads to the main aims and objectives of this study.

\section{Describing orientations} \label{sec:orientations}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\emph{NB: The material in this section is covered by a number of textbooks on texture analysis, namely \cite{bunge1982texture} and \cite{Randle2000}}.




\subsection{Coordinate systems \& orientations} \label{subsec:coordinates}
The key principal behind describing the texture of a polycrystalline material is to be able to describe the orientations of the individual grains within it. In order to accomplish this two coordinates systems must be defined---one for the sample as a whole $(C_S)$ and one for any individual crystal within the sample $(C_C)$. Both systems should be Cartesian, with the directions of the axes usually chosen to best represent the important surfaces or directions within the sample to be studied. Once these two coordinate systems have been established, an orientation $(g)$ can then be defined to be a rotation that maps one coordinate system on to the other such that;



\begin{equation}
C_C\ =\ g \cdot C_S\ ,
\end{equation}  
\\
where in this case, the sample coordinate system is rotated to that of the crystal.




The orientation $g$ can be described in a number of ways. The principal method I will use is through \emph{Euler angles}. A set of Euler angles defines three rotations that transform the sample coordinate system onto the crystal coordinate system and so therefore specify an orientation. I will be using the conventions of \cite{bunge1982texture} such that the three rotation that make up the orientation are defined as $g = \{\varphi_1,\Phi,\varphi_2\}$. The angle $\varphi_1$ is the first rotation about the $Z$ axis, followed by a rotation $\Phi$ about the $X'$ axis in its new orientation, and finally $\varphi_2$ about the $Z''$ axis, in its final orientation (figure \ref{fig:euler_angles}). The order of these rotations is not interchangeable.




\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{euler_angles}
  \caption[Euler angle description]{Example of how the coordinate system of a sheet sample (here the $Z$ axis is in the normal direction ND and the $X$ axis is in the rolling direction RD) can be translated to that of the crystal coordinate system through three rotations $\varphi_1,\Phi,\varphi_2$. From \cite{Randle2000}.}
  \label{fig:euler_angles}
\end{figure}

Having established a method to describe an orientation (i.e. the rotation that maps sample to crystal coordinate systems or vice versa), so too can it describe a misorientation. A misorientation is defined as the rotation that maps one crystal's coordinate system onto another crystal's, rather than to the sample coordinate system (REF). This can be described for two orientations, $g_1$ and $g_2$ such that the misorientation between them $\tilde{g}$ is;

\begin{equation}
\tilde{g} = g_1^{-1}g_2\ .
\end{equation} 

This notation for the misorientation becomes clearer with the introduction of an \emph{orientation matrix}. This is a nine element square rotation matrix constructed in the following way. Consider a crystal coordinate system $C_c = \{X_c,Y_c,Z_c\}$ and a sample coordinate system $C_s = \{X_s,Y_s,Z_s\}$. Then define angles between axes as follows;

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
	\begin{tabular}{c | c c c}

	  & $X_s$      & $Y_s$      & $Z_s$ \\
\hline
$X_c$ & $\alpha_1$ & $\beta_1$ & $\gamma_1$ \\
$Y_c$ & $\alpha_2$ & $\beta_2$ & $\gamma_2$ \\
$Z_c$ & $\alpha_3$ & $\beta_3$ & $\gamma_3$ \\

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\noindent
and so construct the matrix;

\begin{equation}
g = 
\begin{pmatrix}
g_{11} & g_{12} & g_{13} \\
g_{21} & g_{22} & g_{23} \\
g_{31} & g_{32} & g_{33} \\
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
cos \alpha_1 & cos \beta_1 & cos \gamma_1 \\
cos \alpha_2 & cos \beta_2 & cos \gamma_2 \\
cos \alpha_3 & cos \beta_3 & cos \gamma_3 \\
\end{pmatrix}\ .
\end{equation}
\\
This matrix is a useful tool in describing rotation and symmetry operations. Due to orthogonality $g^{-1} = g^T$. 



In addition to Euler angles and rotation matrices, another method for describing the orientation of a crystal, or indeed any number of crystals, in a sample is through the use of \emph{pole figures}. An orientation of an arbitrary crystal face (chosen to best represent the crystal structure) can be described by a vector normal to its surface. This vector, or pole, then corresponds to a point on a unit reference sphere with radius of 1 centred on the crystal (figure \ref{fig:spherical_orientation}). The reference sphere is attached to the sample coordinate system, allowing two angles (the azimuth $\alpha$ and the rotation around the pole axis $\beta$) to represent the orientation of the crystal with respect to that frame.  




\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pole_figure}
  \caption[Pole figure visualisation]{Orientation of the basal (0001) plane in a hexagonal crystal. Projecting the orientation on the reference sphere requires two angles, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In this example, the crystal still has freedom to rotate about the 0001 axis, so more information is required (the $\mathit{10\overline{1}0}$ pole) to describe the orientation in three dimensions. From \cite{Randle2000}.}
  \label{fig:spherical_orientation}
\end{figure}




In order to represent this three dimensional orientation in two dimensions, these poles must be projected onto a two-dimensional plane --- this is done using either stereographic or equal-area projection (the latter most common in geology). By choosing an axis of the sample coordinate system to be the north pole (typically $Z$) so that $\alpha = 0^\circ$ requires the normal of the plane in question to be parallel to that axis. The poles can then be projected as in figure \ref{fig:pole_olivine_example}, which shows an example of pole figures for a simulated olivine sample. Here the density of poles is plotted as a colour intensity. The Miller indicies above the figures show which crystal axes are being considered for each relevant pole figure. In the case of olivine and its cubic crystal shape, the poles of three crystal faces are needed to unambiguously describe its orientation. Any less than this and the crystal has a degree of freedom to rotate about the relevant axes, as in Figure \ref{fig:spherical_orientation}. 




\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth,trim={3.2cm 10cm 0 0},clip]{poles_olivine_example}
  \caption[Pole figure olivine example]{Example of pole figures for a modelled olivine sample. The Miller indices are displayed above the the lower hemisphere projections.}
  \label{fig:pole_olivine_example}
\end{figure}




A pole figure represents the orientation of the crystal coordinate system in the sample coordinate system, but the opposite can also be useful, this is known as the inverse pole figure. In addition to pole figures, other methods of describing orientations exist such as rotation matrices \citep{bunge1982texture,Randle2000} and quaternions \citep{Quaternions}. However these are beyond the scope of this project. 




\subsection{Orientation distribution functions} \label{subsec:ODFs}
In order to perform quantitative analysis of a three dimensional texture in a sample, a two-dimensional pole figure does not contain enough information---a three-dimensional \emph{orientation distribution function} (ODF) is required. Unlike pole figures, ODFs cannot be measured experimentally, they must be calculated from pole figure data. Recalling that a pole direction can be defined by two angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in a pole figure $P_h(y)$, this then corresponds to a region in the ODF which contains all the rotations $\gamma$ about this direction $y$. This results in the following equation; 




\begin{equation} \label{eq:pole_figures}
P_h(y) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \cdot \int_{0}^{2\pi}f(g)\ \mathrm{d}\gamma;\ ,
\end{equation}
\\
where $f(g)$ is the ODF, with $g = \{\varphi_1,\Phi,\varphi_2\}$. In a similar way an inverse pole figure equation can also be derived. As pole figures are two-dimensional projections, multiple pole figures are needed in order to unambiguously describe the three-dimensional ODF.



Solving this equation is known as pole figure inversion, for which no analytic solution exists. One method for approximating the ODF is through spherical harmonic series expansion, such that;




\begin{equation} \label{eq:series_exp}
f(g) = \sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}} \sum_{m=-l}^l \sum_{n=-l}^l C_l^{mn} T_l^{mn} (g) \ ,
\end{equation}
\\
where $T_l^{mn}$ are spherical harmonic functions and $C_l^{mn}$ are expansion coefficients to be determined. Full description of this method \citep[][for detailed description]{bunge1982texture} and other, more direct methods \citep{Randle2000} is beyond the scope of this project.



Pole figure inversion deals with the practicality of obtaining an ODF from experimental pole figure data. However, \cite{bunge1982texture} offers a more intuitive description. Consider $\mathrm{d}V$ to be the volume of all crystals with orientation $g = \{\varphi_1,\Phi,\varphi_2\}$ within the infinitesimal volume element $\mathrm{d}g$ (in Euler space). It follows that;




\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}V(g)}{V} = f(g)\ \mathrm{d}g\ ,
\end{equation}
\\
where $f(g)$ is the ODF, and $V$ is the total sample volume. \cite{Mainprice} state that a \emph{Mis}orientation Distribution Function (MDF) can be defined for a misorientation $\tilde{g}$ in a similar way;




\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}V(\tilde{g})}{V} = f_{MDF}(\tilde{g})\ \mathrm{d}\tilde{g}\ ,
\end{equation}
\\
where $\mathrm{d}V(\tilde{g})/V$ is now the fraction of misorientations in the sample.


%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Texture indices} \label{sec:indicies}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having established a mathematical way of describing the orientations of grains within a sample (the ODF/MDF, herein referred to indiscriminately as the texture function), the next step is to find a method of quantising the \lq{}sharpness\rq{} or strength of a texture.

\subsection{J-index} \label{subsec:j-index}
 One of the longest standing indicies is the $J$ index, as described by \cite{bunge1982texture}, to be the integral of the square of the texture function,




\begin{equation}
J = \int [ f(g) ]^2\ \mathrm{d}g \ ,
\end{equation} 
\\
where the infinitesimal volume element in Euler angle space $\mathrm{d}g$ is given by,




\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d}g = \frac{1}{8\pi^2} \sin\Phi\ \mathrm{d}\Phi\ \mathrm{d}\varphi_1\ \mathrm{d}\varphi_2\ .
\end{equation} 
\\
This definition is true for both $f_{ODF}$ and $f_{MDF}$, the difference only being the definition of $g$ (section \ref{subsec:coordinates}). By substituting the series expansion for the ODF (eq. \ref{eq:series_exp})  and normalising, \cite{bunge1982texture} was able to determine that for a random texture $J_r = 1$. In addition, if the sample is a perfect single crystal, then the texture changes at only one point $g = g_0$, which results in $J_{ideal} \to \infty$, leading to,




\begin{equation}
1 \leq J_{ODF} \leq \infty\ .
\end{equation}
\\
$J_{MDF}$ will not tend to $\infty$ but rather a maximum value. Due to this index involving the square of $f(g)$, \cite{Mainprice} point out that this type of functional is called the $\mathrm{L^2}$-norm. 

In a nearly identical way, and by recalling the definition of pole figures (eq. \ref{eq:pole_figures}) the $J$ index can be defined as,
 
\begin{equation}
J_{P_h(y)} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int [ P_{h}(y) ]^2\ dy\ ,
\end{equation}
\\
with the same holding true for inverse pole figures. By substituting in the series expansion for pole figures and through an integral calculus theorem \citep[p.90]{bunge1982texture} it can be shown that $J_{P_h(y)} \leq J$. This inequality makes sense physically in that the strength of texture in a pole figure cannot be greater than the strength of a texture as a whole, and can take a maximum value when the pole is aligned with the direction of the maximum texture. 


\subsection{M-index} \label{subsec:Mindex}
A more empirical method to quantify texture strength is the M-index. Defined by \cite{Skemer}, the method is based on the difference between a measured misorientation angle distribution $(f^M)$ and a random theoretic distribution $(f^R)$ (based on the sample crystal symmetry). In terms of continuous distribution functions, the index is;

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Mindex_cont}
M \equiv \frac{1}{2} \int | f^M(\theta) - f^R(\theta) |\ \mathrm{d}\theta \ .
\end{equation}  
\\   
However, for practical calculation it is easier to define it as;

\begin{equation}
M \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n | f_i^M - f_i^R | \cdot \frac{\theta_{max}}{2n}\ ,
\end{equation} 
where the calculation is now for $n$ bins and $\theta_{max}$ is the maximum theoretical misorientation angle for the specific crystal symmetry. The factor of a half is for convenience to give the range $0 \leq M \leq 1$.

Now that the necessary theory has been established, the following sections provide a description of how the indices have been implemented. However, to understand the implementation it is important to first introduce the datasets from which the indices will be calculated.  

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Data collection}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data in this project come from two sources; 1) numerical models of deformed polycrystalline aggregates and 2) direct texture measurements from physical specimens using electron backscatter diffraction. 

\subsection{VPSC modelling}
Viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) numerical modelling of LPO \citep{Molinari1987,Lebensohn1993} provides a very versatile dataset of textures to analyse. Using this technique, orientation data can be generated for a polycrystalline material with an entirely random texture, composed of crystals of a specified symmetry. This random texture can then be deformed in a number of ways (simple shear, axial compression etc.), the output of which is the set of Euler angles that describes the orientation of individual grains at time-steps throughout this designated deformation sequence (MAYBE FIG HERE?). Although a number of approaches exist to model polycrystalline deformation such as equilibrium based, purely kinematic or isotropic methods, VPSC is often used because of its robust physical assumptions and relatively quick computation \citep[][and references therein]{Tommasi2000}. 

Some key aspects that differentiate VPSC from other modelling regimes is that it accounts for plastic anisotropy (of both grain and matrix) as well as grain shape effects \citep[as introduced by][]{Lebensohn1993}. It differs from equilibrium based methods as microscopic stress and strain (i.e. for each grain) can vary, provided equilibrium is maintained at macroscopic scale \citep{Tommasi2000}. Effects of nearest neighbour interaction are not taken into account \citep[see][for details]{Castelnau1996}.

VPSC models were run by Dr Andrew Walker (University of Leeds) to provide a range of datasets as outlined in table \textbf{REF}. The output data file contains information such as the number of grains in the simulation and Euler angles for each grain, as well as the strain at each time step. This is the most useful aspect of VPSC modelling, as strain is always known accurately, which is often not the case for physical samples. However, one drawback is that as with any model, there will be elements of reality that are not accounted for and as such physical datasets are required for this project.

	\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Electron backscatter diffraction}
X-ray techniques have long been used to study various properties of crystals and polycrystalline materials. A number of methods have arisen to determine crystal orientation data using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), including electron channeling patterns and X-ray Kossel-line techniques. However, these have been generally surpassed by electron backscatter diffraction \citep[EBSD or backscatter Kikuchi diffraction,][]{Harland1973}.  In essence, an electron beam is fired at a steeply tilted crystalline sample (to decrease path length for backscattered electrons), which produces distinctive backscatter Kikuchi patterns. These patterns are captured by a phosphor screen and digitised by a camera, and can then be analysed by software to determine crystal orientation information from their geometry  \citep{Zaefferer2007}. By moving the stationary beam over the sample, the orientation information of all grains can be determined. \cite{Prior1999} offer a thorough description of the EBSD technique, specifically it use for rock texture, e.g. sample preparation. Further discussion of the technique is beyond the scope of this project \citep[see][]{Schwarzer1997,Randle2000}.    

Orientation data for a number of datasets was measured using EBSD... \textbf{discuss the actual sample sets used here - need to talk to Andrew.}    

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Implementation}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following section provides a general overview as to how these data sources are combined with the theory outlined in chapter \ref{chap:theory} to calculate the texture indices. The two forms of data presented the first challenge, as they needed to be read in and converted to a consistent format. A number of functions were written to extract Euler angles (and other metadata) from both VPSC (edited from original code by Dr Andrew Walker - University of Leeds) and EBSD output files (using some code from *REF*) and store them in identical arrays in \texttt{Matlab} for further processing (first part of table \ref{tab:functions}). Having achieved this, relevant functions were then written to calculate the various indices from these lists of Euler angles describing the orientations of each grain in the sample (with other relevant information such as crystal symmetry). All index functions have similar syntax in their use as demonstrated in listing \ref{lst:calcIndices}, which shows function calls to calculate a number of indices for a VPSC input file within the \texttt{Matlab} environment. Although all functions (see table \ref{tab:functions}) can be used in \texttt{Matlab}, in practice most analysis was carried out in shell scripts to allow efficient batch running with many different inputs.   


\begin{program}[htbp] 
   \centering
   \begin{lstlisting}

                                        'outfile','~/m_cont.out');

% call J-index function and output to file
j = j_index(VPSC,1000,1,'crystal','olivine','outfile','~/j_ind.out');


 \end{lstlisting}
   \caption{Snippet of code to calculate the discrete M-index, continuous M-index and J-index using a VPSC input data file. All indices are calculated for the same 1000 grains, using olivine symmetry, with the output file names given after the \lq{}outfile\rq{} flag. The discrete M-index is calculated with a bin width of 1$^\circ$.}
   \label{lst:calcIndices}
\end{program}

Some elements of the code were optimised when it became apparent that significant computational time was being wasted due to inefficiencies. For example, the time taken to read in a data file using \texttt{read\_{}VPSC} would increase exponentially as more strain steps were added to the VPSC file. Due to the exceptionally large data files (e.g. 10,000 grains per strain increment, with 26 increments gives 260,000 grains total), it was necessary to modify the code so that the read time increased linearly (see ** APPENDIX REF **). 

While developing the software for this project,a number of scientific programming practices were followed --- namely those outlined by \cite{Wilson2014}. For example, extensive documentation is included within the functions themselves, including their usage but also references for relevant theory. In addition, version control software \texttt{Github} was used to track the development and also allow distribution of the code (full \texttt{Matlab} source code available from https://github.com/ee12lmb/matlabSource).
